/*
 * The following algo is slightly different from web.  Because we have DeviceMotion, our heading/pitch change
 * too frequently to run an algo on every change.  So we're using a timer.  But the important part is that the
 * data record the enter and exit events for the ~5°x~5° grid.
 *
 * ALGO:
 *  1) Start a 200ms repeating timer
 *  2) Check the heading/pitch each time the timer fires
 *  2a)   If heading/pitch stayed within 5x5, log the (enter) event and set “look_settled = true”
 *        NB: Not logging each 200ms, just the first time the looks settles
 *  2b)   Else (heading/pitch left the 5x5) if “look_settled == true”, log the (exit) event and set “look_settled = false"
