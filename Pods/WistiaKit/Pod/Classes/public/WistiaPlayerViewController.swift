/**
 `WistiaPlayerViewController` acts much like an `AVPlayerViewController`.  It will display your 
 media including player controls customized in the Wistia fashion, allowing for user-initiated and/or
 programtic control of playback.

 Configure a `WistiaPlayerViewController` with a `WistiaMedia`, or the `hashedID` of one, and it will
 play the best asset for the device and current configuration.
 
 All video types supported by Wistia (currently _flat_ and _spherical_ / _360°_) are handled properly
 by this controller.

 Use the `WistiaPlayerViewControllerDelegate` as a convenient mechanism to respond to key events in the 
 controller's lifecycle.

 - Note: This class is declared `final` as it hooks into the `UIViewController` lifecycle at very specific 
 points.  Functionality is undefined if `extension`s are created that alter or prevent any of view controller 
 lifecycle methods from being called as expected.

    /**
     Initialize a new `WistiaPlayerViewController` without an initial video for playback.
     
     - Important: If you are using [Domain Restrictions](https://wistia.com/doc/account-setup#domain_restrictions),
     referrer must match your whitelist or video will not load.

     - Parameter referrer: The referrer shown when viewing your video statstics on Wistia.
        \
         We recommend using a universal link to the video.
         This will allow you to click that link from the Wistia stats page
         while still recording the in-app playback location.
        \
         In the case it can't be a universal link, it should be a descriptive string identifying the location
         (and possibly state) of your app where this video isbeing played back
         eg. _ProductTourViewController_ or _SplashViewController.page1(uncoverted_email)_

     - Parameter requireHLS: Should this player use only the HLS master index manifest for playback (failing if there
         is not one available for any given `WistiaMedia` or `hashedID`)?
         \
         Apple requires HLS for video over 10m in length played over cellular connections.
         \
         Default, which we recommend, is `true`.
         \
         **NOTE:** You must have HLS enabled for your Wistia account.  Contact support@wistia.com if you're not sure.

     over the lower level `WistiaPlayer`.  For example, due to quirks of the rendering systems, `play` and `pause`
     are handled differently for flat and 360 videos; using `WistiaPlayer.play/pause` may result in

     Leave this nil to have the `WistiaPlayer` choose an optimal asset for the current player configuration and device characteristics.
     - Parameter autoplay: If set to `True`, playback will begin immediately upon loading the video.  If the video is
        already loaded, playback will be resumed.
