# WistiaKit demo for MasterClass

This here's a small app demonstrating WistiaKit, specifically for MasterClass. It's configured to set the `referrer` to "masterclass.com", so videos with MasterClass's Wistia account (which has domain restrictions enabled) will work.

## To run this app:

1. `git clone git@github.com:mrdavidjcole/wistiakit-demo-masterclass.git`
2. `pod install`
3. `open WistiaKitDemoMasterClass.xcworkspace`
4. Run the app
5. Press play!
